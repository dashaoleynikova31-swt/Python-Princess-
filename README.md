# About Me 💖

Hi! I’m **Daria**, a passionate 14-year-old coder from Ukraine. 🌻  
I love learning **Python**, creating small projects, and improving my programming skills every day.  

 🔹 Currently exploring Python projects like **Mood Journal**  
 🔹 Practicing English and coding simultaneously  
 🔹 Interested in self-development, productivity, and creative programming  

I enjoy **making simple tools that can make daily life more fun** and sharing them with the world.  
Always eager to **learn new things, experiment, and grow** as a developer! 🚀
